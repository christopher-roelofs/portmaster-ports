## [DevilutiuonX] () (Diablo 1) v1.5.0

**Port Type:** Native

**Website:**  https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX

**Description**

 DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the  [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki)  for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.


**Instructions** 

 Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD or GoG installation (or extract it from the GoG installer) into /roms/ports/devilution folder. **Do not delete the gamecontrollerdb.txt file in the /roms/ports/devilution folder or there will be no controller support in the game!** For controls, see [here](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Game-Controller-Scheme)  
Important Note: It’s been reported that you must make sure you use the GOG version of diabdat.mpq with the newest patch_rt.mpq or you may experience a freeze of the game around level 20. If you experience issues after a version upgrade, backup your save file and uninstall/reinstall the port. If you make a config change that crashes the game, you can delete the ini file to get the game back to a good state
